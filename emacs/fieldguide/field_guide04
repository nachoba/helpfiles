Starting & Stopping Emacs
-------------------------
Starting Emacs from the command line:

>$ emacs [option...] [file...]
>$ emacs

It's better to use the last option, and then load the file needed.

>$ emacs -Q
Will start Emacs without a splash-page but also won't load personal configurations.

>$ emacs <file> -f read-only-mode
Will start Emacs with the file in read only mode. The -f option tells Emacs to execute
the Lisp function that is specified after the option; in this case toggle-read-only.

Recovering Data after a System Failure
--------------------------------------
Emacs creates the auto-save file in the same directory as the file you are editing.
The name of the file will be the same as the file you are editing, except that there
will be a # character at the beginning and the end of the name.
Whenever you save a file, Emacs automatically removes the auto-save file. If you make
more changes to the file, Emacs creates a new auto-save file. Each time you tell Emacs
to begin work with an existing file, Emacs first checks to see if there exists a 
corresponding auto-save file. If so, it means that the last time you edited the file, 
you were unable to save your work properly. In such cases, Emacs will display a message
like the following:

Auto save file is newer; consider M-x recover-file

Stopping Emacs
--------------
To exit Emacs:

C-x C-c

If files are not save, emacs will ask:

Save file /home/nacho/whatever? (y, n, !, ., q, C-r or C-h)
y    Save the specified file
n    Do not save the specified file
!    Save all the remaining files
q    Quit immediately without saving
.    Save the specified file and then quit
C-r  View specified file
C-h  Display help information
